        <h1>I AM SALAR SALEHI;</h1>

        <p>
          An Iranian citizen interested in the development of Iran, with economics,
          investment, and business development being my professional expertise.
          Alongside this, I have been a serious observer of art, politics,
          and social issues for many years.
          This space exists to gather my views and opinions, and to invite rationality.
